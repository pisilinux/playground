This window is used for defining the update period, cache, proxy and repository
settings.

General settings
----------------

You can modify the general configuration of Pardus package manager, i.e showing
the system tray icon, setting the interval of package update checking etc.

Cache

You can choose how much hard disk cache you can use for downloaded software.
Clicking on the "Clear Cache" button will delete all the downloaded package and
will give you some disk space. Note that this will not affect system stability
or delete installed software at all.

In this tab, you can add, edit or remove a repository using relevant buttons.

Proxy Settings

You can define a proxy server for Package Manager to use for downloading
packages. Proxy settings can be given manually or you may want to choose to use
