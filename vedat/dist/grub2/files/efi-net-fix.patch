Subject: [PATCH] reopen SNP protocol for exclusive use by grub

While working with pxeboot of grub on an ARM platform, I noticed
very poor network performance while grub was loading a kernel
and initramfs. The performance during the loading of grub itself
seemed reasonable. Digging into the issue, I found that the UEFI
firmware was periodically polling for network packets while grub
was downloading files. This was causing timeouts and retries in
the grub network stack.

The solution I found was to reopen the SNP protocol for exclusive
use. This forces UEFI to shutdown its use of SNP so that grub is
not competing for incoming packets.
