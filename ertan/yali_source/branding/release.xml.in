A hostname is an identifier assigned to your computer. As your computer will be recognized with this name in the local network, it is recommended to select a descriptive hostname.</_help>

            <_help>You have to choose a *free* physical partition in order to create your system partitions. If anything goes wrong you can Reset and start again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to use LVM, first you have to create a Physical Volume, then a Volume Group which will contain your Logical Volumes. You can use Logical Volumes similar to partitions and set them for system files, user files, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to use RAID partitions you have to create at least two RAID members. Try to divide the space equally as the space of the disk will be same with the smallest partition. When you have two RAID members, you will be able to create a RAID array which is similar to a partition as it may be formatted and set for the system files, user files, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please refer to Pardus Installing and Using Guide for more information about disk partitioning. You can find it in our website.</_help>

It is responsible for loading the operating system into memory and then transferring the control to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pardus uses GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) as the default bootloader. GRUB allows you to boot any supported operating system by presenting the user with a menu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recommended way to use GRUB is to install it to the beginning of the boot disk, which is set by Default settings. You can choose Advanced settings for a custom installation if you know what you are doing.</_help>

Or you can utilize any KDE application as they can work in Dolpin embedded.
