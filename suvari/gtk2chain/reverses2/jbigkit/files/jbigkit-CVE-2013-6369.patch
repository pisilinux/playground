Subject: [PATCH] Fix two DPPRIV buffer overflows and a bug

* jbig.c:jbg_dec_in(): when a BIE with option DPPRIV=1 was received,
  the included private DP table (1728 bytes) was loaded into
  20-byte array s->buffer, creating a buffer overflow vulnerability.
  It is now loaded instead into a malloc'ed temporary buffer.

* jbig.c:jbg_dec_in(): buffer allocated for internal representation
  of private DP table was 1728 bytes long, but must be 6912 bytes long,
  creating another buffer overflow vulnerability.

* jbig.c: a loop in the routines for converting between the internal and
  external representations of a DP table terminated earlier than intended.
  As a result, a private DP table provided to the decoder was not
  interpreted correctly. Likewise, if a user asked the encoder to output
  its standard DP table (which is only useful for testing), the result
  would have been incorrect.

* tstcodec.c: test case for DPPRIV=1 added.

The buffer overflow vulnerability was reported by Florian Weimer (Red Hat)
and has been assigned CVE-2013-6369.

None of these fixes should affect ABI compatibility; jbig.h remains unchanged.

All past releases of jbig.c are believed to be affected.
The jbig85.c lightwight implementation was not affected.
