Subject: [PATCH] Apply new-windows-always-on-top to newly
 raised/activated windows

A window that raises itself or activates itself is in many ways
like a completely new window. (Once a window is out of the user's
site, they really have no idea if it's mapped or has been withdrawn
by the user.)

If the user has set the new-windows-always-on-top key to make the
behavior for a focus-stealing-prevented *new* window "raise but not
focus", then they'll want the same behavior in the case of
windows that attempt to raise or activate themselves as well.
