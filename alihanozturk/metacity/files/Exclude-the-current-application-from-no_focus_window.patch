Subject: [PATCH] Exclude the current application from no-focus-windows
 setting

The idea of the no-focus-windows setting is to allow identifying
legacy application windows that are stealing focus from other
applications and suppress that behavior. Sometimes its not possible to
identify specific problem windows of an application and its
necessary to blanket add all windows of the application. In this
case no-focus-windows can disrupt the internal flow of focus
within the application.

On the assumption that apps internally handle focus correctly
and have been tested not to steal focus from themselves at
annoying times, we exclude windows of the the current application
from no-focus-windows.
