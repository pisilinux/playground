    - Allow 2 * MinimumPeriod for shared buffers
    - Fix all compiler warnings when compiling with 64-bits
    - Dynamically select low latency mode if less than 2 default periods
      are requested. This requires the rtkit patch to be useful.

    - Uses rtkit to get realtime privileges in a safe manner.
      This allows for more accurate timing and less chance of underruns.
  * dsound patches to work nicer with winepulse
    - Rework that uses event-based handling for rendering. In testing
      with jackd, down to 3.3ms latency was possible. It will still
      underrun once every few seconds, so low latency is not on by
      default. 80 ms will be default latency.

    - On amd64, depend on wine1.4-i386 | wine1.4-dev
      This is a compromise to allow the build daemons to use wine1.4-dev on amd64

      See http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16325
  * debian/control:
    - Recreate wine metapackage, remove wine virtual package
      This way a future app can depend on wine1.5 | wine (>= 1.5.x),
      which should continue working even when wine1.6 is out.
    - Mark transitional packages M-A: foreign
      This way an i386 app depending on wine1.3 will be able to
      pull in amd64 wine1.3, which will then pull in amd64 wine1.4,
      unless the user only has i386 wine1.4 installed, in which case
      apt will then pull in i386 wine1.3 as well.

    - More OLE work, including a builtin stdole32.tlb.
    - Fixed inter-process window resize and repaint.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Changed dummy packages to architecture "all", set rules file's 
    dh_installchangelog to only do architecture dependant ones.  This should 
    keep the changelog out of the dummy packages, making them a good meg smaller

wine (0.0.20041201-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New maintainer Scott Ritchie
  * New Upstream release 20041201
    -Many changes since last package, most notably setup is much simpler and no
     longer requires special tools or configuration files.
  * Removed deprecated winesetuptk and wine-utils.
  * Removed deprecated libwine-* packages, which are now merged into wine.
    -Wine's binaries were required for running winelib compiled packages anyway
  * Changed libwine-dev to wine-dev, all proper development files should now
    be there (everything from /usr/include and the library symlinks).
  * Merged libwine into wine upon advice from upstream authors, as all binaries
    in wine were required by winelib compiled packages anyway.  This package
    should now replace everything wine related that is older.
  * Added dummy packages libwine (which depends on wine) and libwine-dev (which
    depends on wine-dev) in order to ease upgrade from older versions.
  * Removed old Debian hacks into the source code - the source code should be
    the standard winehq.org source now.
  * Changed the package format to a more standard one - as wine was changed
    upstream to be built more consistantly now, and a separate wine-docs package
    is no longer needed.
    -Wine docs such as the user guide are now in /usr/share/doc/wine along with
     the rest of the documentation.
    -Wine development docs such as the winelib user guide are now in
     /usr/share/doc/wine-dev
  * Updated build depends due to upstream changes
  * Upstream wineprefixcreate program now removes the need for the package
    maintainer to create special directories and configuration
  * Many old bugs should be gone due to above changes
  * Upgraded to new standards version of Debian Policy (also removing manual
    prompting code that took place in preinstall script.)

    - Beginnings of proper inter-process window repaints.
    - Several DirectSound improvements.
    - Fixes for the regressions caused by the new filesystem support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Applied winelauncher patch from Kevin Shanahan which allows
    each $WINEPREFIX to have its own flag files to disable
    prelaunch and debug windows.
  * Remove binfmt-support-specific doubledash hack from winelauncher,
    it's apparently no longer needed (nor does it work anymore).
    Closes: #261855.
  * Added Turkish debconf translation. Closes: #252942.

    - Major winedbg rewrite using the dbghelp dll.
    - New Wine preloader to reserve memory areas at startup.
    - Many improvements to the audio support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Acknowledge NMU (closes: #251107), which although imperfectly
    executed, was well meant.
  * Install wine-preloader into libwine.
  * Add GLUT to build dependencies. Closes: #253715.
  * Remove mention of unmaintained daily CVS builds from README.Debian.
    Closes: #252370.
  * Mention wineprefixcreate in README.Debian.
  * Change default winebrowser registry key to "sensible-browser" instead
    of a hardcoded list of common browsers. Closes: #249583.
    This may not change existing installations, it may be necessary for
    you to change the registry entry yourself on existing installations.
    I've mentioned how to do this in README.Debian.
    (It may be possible to make winebrowser ignore the registry entry
    entirely and hardcode it to always use sensible-browser, but I
    am not sure if that's a good idea.)

wine (0.0.20040505-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040505 (Closes: #248554)
    - Many more filesystem improvements, including autodetection
      of drive types and devices, and support for editing the drive
      configuration with winecfg.
    - Many Direct3D improvements.
    - Several fixes to the various sound drivers.

wine (0.0.20040408-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040408 (Closes: #245679)
    - DOS devices and drives are now configured through symlinks.
    - Many shell32 improvements.
    - New task manager merged from ReactOS.
    - First version of wineprefixcreate tool for initial setup.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Redirect errors from final "kill" command in winelauncher to
    /dev/null, since any failures there should be harmless.
    Closes: #238065.
  * Install taskmgr into wine-utils.
  * Set ICUUC_LIB and ICUDATA_LIB variables for configure,
    needed to compile this Wine release against the old ICU
    version in Debian, as instructed by Shachar Shemesh.
  * Adapted skeleton wine configuration in /usr/share/wine/skel
    to contain DOS device and drive symlinks. For existing
    installs, it seems wine will convert the old config to the
    new symlink-based scheme automatically, for a limited
    transition period. But I thought it best to update the
    packaging now anyway, to make sure I got it right before
    it's too late.
  * Install wineprefixcreate into wine. This seems to be
    an alternative to copying /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine.
  * Added Danish debconf translation. Closes: #234064.

wine (0.0.20040309-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040309
    - Much improved winegcc tool, now used to build Wine itself.
    - VxDs are now separate libraries for better modularity.
    - Improvements and simplifications to the drive configuration.
    - New setupapi INF script to create the initial registry.
    - Many improvements to the various multimedia dlls.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Moved skeleton wine configuration from /usr/share/wine to
    /usr/share/wine/skel. Updated README.Debian to reflect this.
  * Install patched tools/wineinstall into /usr/share/wine.
    If the script happens to work, it might be better to use it
    than copying the /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine, since
    it would also be able to upgrade an old installation, and
    has more tweaks, but I haven't tested this script much lately.
  * Moved wineconf from /usr/lib/wine to /usr/share/wine.
  * Install generic.ppd and wine.inf in /usr/share/wine.
  * There's no longer a winedefault.reg. Everything is handled by
    wine.inf. Added explanation on how to use wine.inf to
    README.Debian.
  * Create program symlinks manually in debian/rules instead of
    using dh_link, since these symlinks must be absolute, otherwise
    they won't work when "cp -r"-ed into ~/.wine. Closes: #235406.
  * Try to make winelauncher look for an existing config file
    in $WINEPREFIX (before complaining that you have to run
    winesetup). Closes: #235405.
  * There's now a man page for widl.
  * There's now a man page for winebuild. Closes: #114673.
  * Update libwine-* package list in README.Debian.

    - Several Winelib compatibility fixes.
    - Beginnings of support for typelib creation.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Moved wine.bin, wine-[kp]thread and wineserver from wine to libwine,
    since these are going to be needed for Winelib programs too.
  * Added winebrowser and expand to the wine package.
  * Added libfontconfig1-dev, libssl-dev, and libcapi20-2 to
    Build-Depends.
  * Added new package libwine-capi to contain the capi20 module.

    to supersede the currently NPTL-incompatible version
    in testing).
  * Fixed debian/rules to also make libwine-jack depend

    - Better support for video playback.
    - Full IME support for Asian locales.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * The exec shield workaround was also disabled again upstream
    "because it caused too much trouble". Perhaps #224837 was
    some of that trouble. Need verification.
  * Build-Depend on libjack0.80.0-dev instead of libjack0.71.2-dev.

    - Some support for Netbios functions.
    - Work around for Exec Shield and prelinking troubles.
    - Many code cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * It seems regapi is no more, have to remove it from the
    packages. (A man page for it is not needed anymore then,
    which closes #83261)
  * The tool regedit supersedes it, so I'm using that now to
    build the skeleton configuration in /usr/share/wine. I
    patched regedit to accept input from stdin if a filename
    of "-" is given, so input can still be zcat-ed to it.
  * Updated README.Debian for regedit instead of regapi, and
    mention that regedit is in wine-utils (still).

    - Lots of code merges from Crossover Office 2.1.
    - Some reorganization of the source tree.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Install wine.bin-kthread and wine.bin-pthread binaries into
    /usr/bin to allow the threading autoselection to work.
  * The DNS lookup issues is also claimed to have been fixed now,
    probably because of the NPTL detection. Closes: #214252.

    - Support for the Xrandr extension.
    - Dll separation of kernel and ntdll is finished.
    - Many enhanced metafile improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * DocBook DSSSL stylesheets are apparently no longer included in the
    upstream source. However, they have one available separately
    (in the "tools" module of CVS), so I put it into the debian/
    directory and let the debian/rules file generate the documentation
    itself (without using upstream makefile) using that stylesheet.
    I also chose to continue to build each book as many small HTML
    files instead of as one big HTML file, since that's the "tried and
    true" way, or something.
  * Some old plaintext documentation has also been removed upstream,
    they've been removed from the packaging too.
  * Added HURD and FreeBSD to architecture fields, as requested.

    - Lots of bug fixes.
    (Yes, newer upstream releases exist, I plan to upload each of

  * Install rpcss, rundll32, start, winemenubuilder into libwine.
  * Install *.def files into libwine-dev.
  * Build-depend on libicu-dev, so that support for non-Western
    languages gets compiled in. Suggest libicu21c102 for libwine.
  * Added missing "]" in winedefault.reg. Closes: #218612.
  * Fixed doc-base (it apparently got broken after the wine-doc
    changes). Closes: #215393.
  * Fixed dash compatibility of winelauncher. Closes: #219624.
  * Noted that daily builds haven't been working lately
    in README.Debian. Closes: #213729.
  * Tried to fix configure to detect current freetype.
  * Started rewriting the build system a little bit to make it
    possible to make winelauncher configure Wine automatically
    without winesetup's help. This is not finished yet, though,
    and since I'm far behind on Wine releases now, I think I'll
    do it later. Still, I did get around to po-debconfify the
    still unused debconf templates (closes: #203286), and put
    a skeleton per-user no-Windows configuration into
    /usr/share/wine that it's possible to copy into ~/.wine for
    those who want to do so.
  * Updated README.Debian to reflect (some of) the above.

    I am not sure that this jack version will work with Wine, but since
    0.50.0 is apparently no longer in unstable, I guess I have no choice.
    Closes: #202237.
  * Changed wine-doc build rules a bit to be more in line with upstream
    documentation layout. This will change the directory layout in the
    wine-doc package, you may have to adjust your bookmarks. Closes: #202310.
  * Added winecfg program to wine-utils.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.0, rearranged debian/rules file
    a bit to have a separate binary-indep rule for building wine-doc.
  * Corrected sections in control file (finally).

  * Moved sample config files potentially referenced from postinst
    from /usr/share/doc/wine to /usr/share/wine, and added symlinks
    to them in /usr/share/doc/wine, as per Debian policy.
  * There's a new generic.ppd among the sample config files, I'm

    - Serial async I/O improvements
    - Support for app-specific dll overrides in config file

  * New build dependency libperl-dev (because of the new
    winetest program, which is supposed to be wine's new
    API test suite, but though it was necessary to compile
    it, I don't think it's useful to have in the debian
    packages, is it?)
  * There's a new winecheck script too, but I didn't include
    it either, as I'm not sure how it works and whether it
    would be useful in Debian packages.
  * Made the dependency on xbase-clients versioned >= 4.0,
    so it doesn't satisfy potato xfree86 3.x users, forcing
    the ORed xcontrib dependency instead.
  * Added Suggests: msttcorefonts (neat package).

  * libwine_tsx11.so is new, placed it in /usr/lib.
  * specmaker is new, placed it in wine-utils.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain the MesaGL mess.
  * Built with debhelper v3.
  * Moved winemaker from libwine-dev to wine-utils, since it's just a
    porting tool for preparing windows for winelib compilation, not
    a build requirement once the sources have been prepared.
  * Removed rpath hack from debian/rules, assuming that winelauncher
    does a good enough job (or recognizing that the upstream configure
    adds rpath itself so I wouldn't have to anyway).
  * Patched winelauncher a lot, so now it works without rpath in the
    Debian packaging, and works with the winelib apps.
  * Moved /usr/lib/*.so symlinks to libwine-dev.
  * Finally moved the /var/lib/wine stuff from libwine to wine.
  * Someone apparently translated libwine.templates to German.
    While not terribly useful (the first message might be obsolete
    and the other isn't actually used, at least not right now),
    especially not without also translating wine.templates, I just
    threw it into libwine.templates anyway to close the bug.

    file, so the default wine.conf is now removed from the package.
    I'll just have to recommend using winesetuptk for now.
  * Using debconf to notify the sysadmin of the above issue, and ask
    whether to delete /etc/wine.conf.
  * Decided to use winelauncher like it was intended; rename the main
    wine binary to wine.bin, and rename winelauncher to wine.
    This will also automatically launch winesetup if there's no config.
  * Removing wine.conf in postrm if wine is purged.

wine (0.0.20001222-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added usr/lib to libwine-dev.dirs. (Oops.)
  * Added ldconfig to libwine.postinst.
  * Now that winesetuptk is available, I added winesetup to Suggests,
    and mentioned it in README.Debian. The next Wine release ought to
    have support for a new global config file, I plan to remove wine.conf
    from the package once that happens.
  * Added information about other sources for Wine .deb packages
    (from the WineHQ download page) to README.Debian.

  * New upstream release 20001222.
    The configuration file format has changed, but I've kept the wine.conf
    in here since the winesetuptk tool isn't ready yet (I'm waiting for it
    to handle the new configuration file format), and wine will simply
    automatically generate a ~/.wine/config using the old wine.conf.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain these config issues.
  * Built more of the winelib apps, put some of them (including the
    all-important "winemine") into wine-utils.

wine (0.0.20001202-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20001202.
    New tools winelauncher and wineshelllink.
    Updated wine.conf.
    (I ought to use winelauncher for something, maybe soon.)
  * Updated Build-Depends for XFree86 4.0.
  * Install regapi into wine. Closes: #76138, #47857.
    Also put winedefault.reg into wine instead of libwine.
    Will clean up the inconsistencies, such as drive setup
    and files being in libwine instead of wine, later.
  * Moved winebuild, wmc, and wrc from wine-utils and
    into libwine-dev, since these are tools required for
    compiling Winelib apps.
  * Added LDFLAGS with rpath set to /usr/lib/wine as arguments
    to make during build, so that regapi and winedbg works.
    Closes: #72243 (may have been closed by 20001026-2 too).
    Eventually DLL separation will remove the need for rpath,
    but I'll keep it until then.
  * Added a new fake drive for /usr/bin, so that wine can find
    winedbg.

wine (0.0.20001026-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repackaged with debhelper, since debmake proved too limited.
    Closes: #69467, #69469, #69570, #70820, #71461.
  * The default wine.conf update and the libdir fix (and
    the repackaging) closes: #67381, #67382.
  * Reorganized wine-doc package, it now features HTML docs.
  * Took Windows directories with spaces out of the package proper,
    since debhelper didn't cope with them. Created them in postinst
    instead for now.
  * Some initial debconf support. But doing real configuration
    questions must wait until I've patched the upstream
    tools/wineinstall script for easier debconf integration.
  * Moved Drive C path from /usr/share/wine/drivec to
    /var/lib/wine/drivec for FHS compliance. (libwine.preinst takes
    care of moving the actual contents and performing a search &
    replace in wine.conf.) Closes: #70618, #70619, #70620.

  * Added a few Windows directories into the /usr/share/wine/drivec.
  * Add an empty winsock.dll file to Windows directory in libwine.
  * Initialize win.ini and system.ini in Windows directory in
    libwine.postinst. (Hmm. Wonder if a --purge should remove everything?
    If the user only wanted to remove the .deb to compile wine himself,
    that might be a bad idea if the user installed something...)
