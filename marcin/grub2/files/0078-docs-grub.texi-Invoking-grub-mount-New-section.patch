+@chapter Invoking grub-mount
+
+The program @command{grub-mount} performs a read-only mount of any file
+system or file system image that GRUB understands, using GRUB's file system
+drivers via FUSE.  (It is only available if FUSE development files were
+present when GRUB was built.)  This has a number of uses:
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+It provides a convenient way to check how GRUB will view a file system at
+boot time.  You can use normal command-line tools to compare that view with
+that of your operating system, making it easy to find bugs.
+
+@item
+It offers true read-only mounts.  Linux does not have these for journalling
+file systems, because it will always attempt to replay the journal at mount
+time; while you can temporarily mark the block device read-only to avoid
+this, that causes the mount to fail.  Since GRUB intentionally contains no
+code for writing to file systems, it can easily provide a guaranteed
+read-only mount mechanism.
+
+@item
+It allows you to examine any file system that GRUB understands without
+needing to load additional modules into your running kernel, which may be
+useful in constrained environments such as installers.
+
+@item
+Since it can examine file system images (contained in regular files) just as
+easily as file systems on block devices, you can use it to inspect any file
+system image that GRUB understands with only enough privileges to use FUSE,
+even if nobody has yet written a FUSE module specifically for that file
+system type.
+@end itemize
+
+Using @command{grub-mount} is normally as simple as:
+
+@example
+grub-mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
+@end example
+
+@command{grub-mount} must be given one or more images and a mount point as
+non-option arguments (if it is given more than one image, it will treat them
+as a RAID set), and also accepts the following options:
+
+@table @option
+@item --help
+Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
+
+@item --version
+Print the version number of GRUB and exit.
+
+@item -C
+@itemx --crypto
+Mount encrypted devices, prompting for a passphrase if necessary.
+
+@item -d @var{string}
+@itemx --debug=@var{string}
+Show debugging output for conditions matching @var{string}.
+
+@item -K prompt|@var{file}
+@itemx --zfs-key=prompt|@var{file}
+Load a ZFS encryption key.  If you use @samp{prompt} as the argument,
+@command{grub-mount} will read a passphrase from the terminal; otherwise, it
+will read key material from the specified file.
+
+@item -r @var{device}
+@itemx --root=@var{device}
+Set the GRUB root device to @var{device}.  You do not normally need to set
+this; @command{grub-mount} will automatically set the root device to the
+root of the supplied file system.
+
+If @var{device} is just a number, then it will be treated as a partition
+number within the supplied image.  This means that, if you have an image of
+an entire disk in @file{disk.img}, then you can use this command to mount
+its second partition:
+
+@example
+grub-mount -r 2 disk.img mount-point
+@end example
+
+@item -v
+@itemx --verbose
+Print verbose messages.
